Introduction
============

[IcyTree](https://tgvaughan.github.io/icytree) is a browser-based phylogenetic
tree viewer intended for rapid visualization of phylogenetic trees and
networks. While originally intended for the visualization of rooted time trees
such as those inferred by Bayesian inference packages such as BEAST and
MrBayes, IcyTree can be used to visualize any rooted tree which is provided in
a supported format.

In addition, IcyTree can be used to produce visualizations of phylogenetic
networks represented using the Extended Newick format.

**Warning:** IcyTree does _not_ produce visualizations of unrooted trees, but
may still display such trees as rooted if a root is implied by the input file
format.  (For instance, Newick formatted tree files always implicitly specify a
root.) It is important not to read significance into the placement of the root
in such situations. Instead, one should use a specialised unrooted tree viewer
to view such files.

IcyTree should work well on the latest desktop versions of
[Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop) or
[Mozilla Firefox](http://mozilla.org/firefox).
**These are the only officially supported browsers.**  While some users
report success with web browsers such as Apple's Safari, we can't guarantee
that all features of IcyTree will work on other browsers.

Input/Output
============

This section describes the various ways of getting phylogenetic data into and
out of IcyTree.

Supported input file formats
----------------------------

IcyTree supports the following input file formats:

1. Plain Newick

    These files contain one or more plain
    [Newick tree format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newick_format) strings.
    In this format, each edge may have a length and each node may have a single
    label. Multiple Newick tree format strings are separated by newlines.
    **Note that when multiple trees are specified, each Newick string must
    be terminated by a semicolon ';'.**

2. NEXUS files with a trees block

    [NEXUS files](http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/46.4.590)
    contain an optional trees block which may hold one or more trees specified
    in Newick format.

3. PhyloXML

    PhyloXML (read the [paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-10-356)
    or visit the [web page](http://www.phyloxml.org)) is a dedicated
    phylogenetic tree format and may contain one or more trees. IcyTree skips
    any unrooted trees when loading the file.

4. NeXML

    NeXML (read the [paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/sys025) or visit
    the [web page](http://www.nexml.org)) is another dedicated tree format.
    IcyTree will skip any unrooted trees when loading the file.
    

### NEXUS Annotations

While the PhyloXML and NeXML formats allow for annotation of nodes and edges,
Newick format only allows nodes to be given a single label (which may be
interpreted as referring to the node itself or the edge above it). BEAST (all
versions) and FigTree use the comment facility of NEXUS to embed annotations in
Newick strings.  (See
[here](https://code.google.com/archive/p/beast-mcmc/wikis/NexusMetacommentFormat.wiki)
for a technical description.)

IcyTree parses these annotations and makes them available
for styling the tree.

### Extended Newick

The [extended Newick format](http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-9-532)
provides a standard way of representing phylogenetic networks using a simple
extension of the Newick format.  IcyTree can visualize rooted networks encoded
using this format.  The specific visualization approach is most suitable for
timed networks (where all edge lengths represent lengths of time), but the
network topology of all rooted networks is faithfully represented.

Loading trees from files
------------------------

To load one or more trees from a file, simply open the File menu and select
"Load from file". This will bring up a file selection dialog box from which
you can choose a file to load.

Alternatively, simply use a mouse to drag and drop a tree file directly onto
the IcyTree window.

Entering trees directly
-----------------------

Trees can also be entered directly into IcyTree by selecting File-&gt;"Enter
tree directly".  This will open a dialog containing a text box in which trees
can be entered using their Newick representation.  (In fact, it is possible to
enter trees using any of the supported formats, although this feature is
probably most useful for simple Newick descriptions.)

Loading trees from a URL
------------------------

To load one or more trees from a file identified using a URL, open the
File menu and select "Load from URL".  This will display a dialog box
where you can enter a URL.  Pressing the Load button will then attempt
to load the file at this URL.

You can also load files from a URL by appending the URL pointing to
the tree file to IcyTree's URL, with a "?" separating the two.  For
instance, suppose a tree file is hosted at
http://example.edu/tree.newick. Pointing your (IcyTree-compatible) web
browser at the following address will load IcyTree and open the file:

    http://icytree.org/?url=http://example.edu/tree.newick

This also means that it is possible to embed links in web pages which
cause browsers to view trees in IcyTree.  For instance, clicking on the
[this link](https://icytree.org/?url=https://icytree.org/examples/primates.newick) opens an IcyTree visualisation of a primate tree.

Technical note: the URL loading facility requires the server on which
the file is hosted allow cross-origin access. In the case that the
request fails, IcyTree attempts to use a CORS proxy to access the
file, but this may fail if the availability of the proxy changes.

Attaching Metadata
------------------

To load additional metadata corresponding to the tips of a tree, open
the File menu and select "Attach metadata from CSV". The following delimiters
are supported: ",", ";", "\t", and "|". The imported metadata will appear as
attribute of the tips and can, for example, be used to colour the nodes by selecting
an attribute in the Style menu under "Colour nodes by".

Saving images
-------------

IcyTree uses Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) to draw trees in the browser. These
graphics can be easily exported using File-&gt;"Export tree as"-&gt;"SVG
image".  Once exported, the graphic can be loaded into vector graphics editing
programs such as [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org) or [Adobe
Illustrator](http://adobe.com/products/illustrator) for modification and
conversion into other vector graphics formats such as PDF and EPS.

In addition, File-&gt;"Export tree as"-&gt;PNG/JPEG can be used to produce
a bitmap image of the currently-displayed tree. Note that the resolution
of the produced image is dependent on the current size of the browser window.

Saving tree files
-----------------

In addition to exporting graphics, IcyTree can export trees as Newick, NEXUS,
PhyloXML or NeXML using the remaining items in the File-&gt;"Export tree as"
menu.  Note that the Newick export conforms strictly to the (Extended) Newick
format - additional node annotations will not be included in the generated
file. All other formats support annoations. (NEXUS file export produces a file
which includes BEAST-style node annotations).

Note that networks can only be exported using the Newick/NEXUS formats.

In the case that multiple trees are loaded, only the tree currently visible is
exported.

Exploring trees
===============

Once a tree is loaded, it can be explored in a variety of ways.

Panning and Zooming
-------------------

The principle method of exploration is via panning and zooming the view of the
displayed tree.  To zoom in or out, simply hover the mouse cursor over a
position of interest and scroll "up" or "down" respectively on your mouse's
scroll wheel.  To pan, simply click and drag.

Horizontal/Vertical Zooming
---------------------------

To zoom in or out in the horizontal or vertical directions only, hold down SHIFT
or CTRL respectively while moving the scroll wheel.

Viewing Tree Edge Statistics
----------------------------

Hovering over a tree edge will cause a table to appear describing the edge.
The table will vanish when your mouse leaves he edge, but not if you hover over
the table itself.

**Note that you cannot pan or zoom if your mouse cursor is hovering over the
edge description table.**

Outlining and Collapsing Clades
-------------------------------

Hovering over a tree edge and clicking the left mouse button will cause the
clade/sub-tree descending from that edge to be "outlined" - i.e., drawn as
a triangle that occupies the same vertical space as the original clade but
obscures the internal detail.  This
can be useful for large trees as a means to focus attention on the bulk structure
of the tree.

Holding down the Alt key while clicking on an edge produces a similar effect,
but causes the clade to be "collapsed" - i.e. replaced by a triangle that
occupies the same vertical space as a *single* leaf node.  Again, this is
useful for exploring the structure of large trees.

Clicking on an outlined/collapsed clade will restore the original representation
of that clade.

The clade collapse mechanism is also applicable to networks.  However, the
concept of clade is not so easily defined in this case.  The present behaviour
is to collapse only those descendants that do not descend from recombinant
edges. (See the Recombinant Edges section of the manual for information on
what is meant by "recombinant edge".)

Re-rooting Trees
----------------

While for the most part IcyTree is only intended for *viewing* rather than editing
trees, it does allow users to select a new root position for the tree.  This is useful
in situations where an inference procedure has produced an unrooted tree but where the presence
of an outgroup allows the user to be certain of the true location of the root.

To re-root a tree, simply hover the mouse cursor over an edge, and click the left mouse button
while holding down the SHIFT key.  This produces a new root node exactly in the middle of the
selected edge.

Be aware that **re-rooting trees with node annotations that actually apply to immediately ancestral edges
can produce meaningless annotations**. See
[this article](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/09/07/035360)
for more details.

The re-rooting can also be applied to networks.  However, in the case of timed
networks the lengths of the recombinant edges cannot in general be preserved
and in some circumstances may produce negative edge lengths.

Changing the order of tree nodes
--------------------------------

When node sorting is disabled (i.e. Style-&gt;"Node sorting" as discussed in the
next section is set to "Unsorted"), the order of children below a given internal node
can be manually rotated by hovering the mouse cursor over the edge immediately
parental to this node and clicking the RIGHT mouse button.

Visualization style
===================

IcyTree provides a number of options for adjusting the style of visualization
presented.  These are all accessible via the Style menu, which is available once
a tree has been loaded. Each of the items in that menu are described in the
subsections below.

Node sorting
------------

The order in which child nodes appear under each parent node in the displayed
tree can be modified using the Style-&gt;"Node Sorting" menu. The default
behaviour is for child nodes to be sorted so that children possessing larger
subtrees are always positioned below (in the vertical axis of the
visualization) children with smaller subtrees.  For serially-sampled
time-trees, this gives rise to a tree that descends down the screen from left
to right. We thus refer to this kind of sorting as **descending**.

Alternatively, child nodes can be sorted in so that those possessing larger
subtrees are *above* those with smaller subtrees. This referred to in the
sorting options list as **ascending**.

Finally, child nodes can be left **unsorted**.  This leaves the ordering of the
nodes completely up to the input format.  Note that only the Newick, NEXUS and
PhyloXML formats implicitly specify an ordering, while the NeXML format does
not, so be aware that "unsorted" will always lead to an arbitrary ordering of
child nodes for NeXML trees.

Tree layouts
------------

IcyTree provides the following three tree layouts:

1. **Standard Time Tree**

    This is the layout used to draw traditional time trees and is used by default
    whenever all edge lengths are defined. Child nodes
    are evenly spaced on the vertical axis, and the vertical position of
    each parent is exactly mid-way between each child.  The horizontal
    position of each node corresponds to the time that the corresponding event
    (e.g. coalescence, speciation, sampling) occurred. 

2. **Cladogram**

    This layout uses the same vertical positioning of nodes as the time tree
    layout but positions nodes so that the distance from the left indicates the
    *rank* of each node.  The rank of any internal node is simply one more than the
    maximum rank of any of its children, while the rank of a leaf node is always
    zero.

    The cladogram layout is the only layout available to trees that do not
    have lengths defined for every edge and is automatically selected in this case.

3. **Transmission tree**

    This layout yields exactly the same horizontal node positions as as the
    standard time tree layout, but sets the vertical position of each parent to be
    identical to that of the left-most child. This allows pathogen transmission
    trees in which distinct vertical positions correspond to distinct hosts to be
    drawn.

    Note that selection of this layout disables node sorting, as in this case
    the ordering of child nodes provided by the input file is assumed to be
    significant.

Text labels
-----------

IcyTree displays Newick labels or NEXUS taxon names for leaf nodes by default.
This selection can be modified using the Style-&gt;"Tip text" menu, either by
selecting "None" to turn off tip labels entirely or by selecting one of the
other available node attributes to use in labelling the leaf nodes.

Labelling of internal nodes is off by default but can be turned on by selecting
from the available attributes listed in the Style-&gt;"Internal node text" menu.

Particularly when labelled singleton nodes (i.e. internal nodes with a single
child node) exist, internal node labels can be difficult to read.  To improve
visibility in such cases, select the Style-&gt;"Angle node label text" menu
item, which causes all text labels to be drawn at a 45 degree angle.

Node and edge colouring
-----------------------

IcyTree allows tree nodes and edges to be coloured according to the
value of any of the labels or attributes defined on the nodes. In the
case of edges, attributes are understood to apply to the edge
immediately ancestral to the node with which the attribute is associated
in the input file.

To use edge colouring, choose the specific attribute using the
Style-&gt;"Colour edges by" sub-menu. Similarly for nodes, choose the
attribute using the Style-&gt;"Colour nodes by" sub-menu.  In either
case, when an item other than "None" is selected, objects are coloured
automatically by applying a distinct colour to each set of objects
having a distinct value for the chosen attribute.  Edges/nodes for
which the chosen attribute is undefined remain coloured black.

The specific colours used are selected by sorting the unique attribute
values (numerically if all values are numeric, lexographically
otherwise) and assigned unique colours with maximally-separated hues
to make distinct attribute values as easy to discern as possible.

A legend showing the mapping from trait values to colours can be
toggled on and off using Style-&gt;"Display legend".

Relative edge width
-------------------

IcyTree also allows the relative width of the lines used to draw tree edges to be
influenced by any label or attribute that has numeric values that range between
0 and 1.  Just as for edge colouring, node attributes determine the relative width of
the edge immediately ancestral to each node.

The attribute used for relative edge width can be chosen via the Style-&gt;"Relative
edge width" sub-menu. (Only compatible attributes are shown.)

Marking singleton nodes
-----------------------

IcyTree defines "singletons" as those nodes which have exactly one child.  Such
nodes may be used to represent a variety of events including ancestral
migrations or sampled ancestors.  Unless the adjacent edges are differently
coloured due to a change in some attribute value, these nodes are by default
invisible.  IcyTree thus allows such nodes to be explicitly marked with solid
black circles.  This marking can be toggled using the Style-&gt;"Mark singleton
nodes" option.

Collapsing zero-length edges
----------------------------

Some phylogenetic software packages produce time trees in which with a subset
of the edges have a zero length.  Such edges may be used to encode
non-binary time tree elements (sampled ancestors, polytomies) within a
binary tree.  The option Style-&gt;"Collapse zero-length edges", which
is enabled by default, causes these "dummy" edges to be ommitted from
the tree when it is drawn.  (To make the resulting sampled ancestor
nodes visible, use the Style-&gt;"Mark singleton nodes" option
described above.)

Error bars
----------

Some phylogenetics inference packages (including both
[BEAST](http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk) and [BEAST 2](http://beast2.org)) produce
phylogenetic trees that include information about node age uncertainty.  In the
case of BEAST and BEAST 2, this is indicated using vector-valued node
attributes that contain the 95% highest posterior density interval for each
node age.  These intervals can be displayed by IcyTree as node age error bars
by selecting the appropriate attribute from the Style-&gt;"Node height error
bars" sub-menu.

Recombinant edges
-----------------

IcyTree uses the term "recombinant edge" to refer to any *additional edges*
immediately ancestral to a node. These existence of these edges mean that the
displayed genealogy is a *network* rather than a simple tree.

The only format in which IcyTree accepts descriptions of phylogenetic networks
is the [Extended Newick format](http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-9-532).  In
this format, there is a distinction made between the first parental edge and
these additional edges.  Whether or not this distinction is meaningful is up to
the author of the extended Newick file.

In IcyTree, the additional "recombinant" edges are drawn using dashed lines.
This is done simply as a strategy to make it easier for networks to be
understood: drawing rooted networks often requires lines representing edges to
cross, and using dashed lines for these "recombinant" edges makes it easier to
distinguish between line joinings that represent lineage
coalescences/bifurcations and those that are simply a result of a busy network.

In addition, the dashed/solid distinction can be used to encode useful
information, as it is in the output of
[Bacter](https://tgvaughan.github.io/bacter) which uses the primary parental
edge as the one representing the clonal ancestry of a bacterial sample and the
recombinant edges to represent ancestry due to gene conversion.

The following style menu options apply specifically to "recombinant edges" and networks:

* **Display recombinant edges**

    This option is selected by default but can be turned off to completely hide
    recombinant edges.  This is only useful if the distinction between the primary
    ancestral edge and the additional "recombinant" ancestral edges holds semantic
    value.

* **Recombinant edge text**

    This option can be used to apply additional text, if available, directly to
    recombinant edges.  This text is taken from the Newick label (or NEXUS node
    annotation) on the "hybrid" leaf node in the extended Newick file. (See [the
    paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-9-532) describing the extended
    Newick format for details on hybrid nodes.)

* **Recombinant edge width**

    This option uses a numeric trait value (which must lie between 0 and 1) on each
    "hybrid" leaf node to determine the relative width of the dashed line representing the
    corresponding recombinant edge.

*  **Inline recombinant edges**

    Enabling this option causes an alteration in the layout so that nodes
    representing coalescences between a recombinant edge and a non-recombinant edge
    are positioned directly in line with the non-recombinant descendent node of the
    coalescence node. This option is off by default.

* **Recombinant edge length minimize**

    This option toggles whether recombinant edges are positioned in such a way that they
    minimize the length of the dashed line used to represent the edge.  This option
    is on by default.

Time Axis
---------

When a tree layout other than "Cladogram" is selected (i.e. Standard Time Tree
or Transmission Tree), the horizontal position of nodes corresponds to the time
at which the corresponding event occurred. These times are visible in the edge
statistics box that appears when the mouse cursor is moved over individual
edges. IcyTree can additionally display a horizontal axis to make it easier to
see at a glance when these events occurred. 

To turn the axis on, select either "Age" or "Forwards Time" from the
Style-&gt;Axis sub-menu. "Age" causes the numerical labels on the axis to
increase from right to left (i.e. representing age *before* some chosen time)
while "Forwards Time" causes the numbers to increase from left to right (i.e.
representing time *after* some chosen time).

In either case, the age/time of the most recent leaf on the tree (i.e. the node
furthest to the right) defaults to zero.  This means that ages will by default
represent ages before the most recent sample (which is often the present) but
that selecting "Forward Time" will initially result in negative numbers increasing
from the left and reaching zero at the most recent sample.

IcyTree allows users to select a different time/age for the most recent sample by
choosing Style-&gt;"Set axis offset".  This brings up a dialog box through which
users can modify this value.

### Log Scale

It is often the case, particularly with gene trees that are drawn from something similar
to a coalescent distribution, that the vast majority of the internal nodes of the tree
are in the very recent past and only a handful of nodes are much older.  In such cases,
placing the tree on a linear time scale can make it difficult to simultaneously see the
overall structure of the tree in a single window.

To address this problem, IcyTree can use something akin to a logarithmic scale
to position nodes on time trees, with the horizontal distance between the node
and the most recent sample being proportional to the logarithm of the sum of
the time difference and some offset. That is,

&delta;x &prop; log(&delta;t + &omega;)

where &delta;x is the horizontal distance between a point on the tree and the most
recent sample (youngest leaf), &delta;t is the corresponding time difference and
$$\omega$$ is a positive offset.  The offset is included to allow the most recent sample
to be included in the figure, and its magnitude determines how much the transformation
affects the tree shape with smaller values of $$\omega$$ resulting in a stronger magnifying
effect on the recent portions of the tree.

To switch this mode on or off, select Style-&gt;"Log scale".  To adjust the offset
value, hold down the Alt key while moving the mouse wheel. Moving the scroll wheel
"up" reduces the offset and increases the strength of the transformation, while
moving it "down" increases the offset and reduces the strength of the transformation.

The best way to get an understanding of these options is to try them out!

General Style Options
---------------------

The final set of Style options apply more generally. It includes the following options:

* **Edge Width**

    This is a sub-menu containing options to uniformly increase or decrease the
    width of all lines used to represent tree and network edges.

* **Font Size**

    Likewise, this is a sub-menu containing options to increase or decrease the
    size of the font used to display all text in the visualization.

* **Label precision limit**

    This is a sub-menu which allows users to select the number of significant
    figures used when displaying numeric text labels.  By default an arbitray
    number of significant figures is permitted.

* **Angle node label text**

    As described previously, toggling this option causes all node labels to be
    angled 45 degrees upward.  This can make it easier to read internal node
    labels, particularly those corresponding to singleton nodes.

* **Anti-alias**

    By default, lines representing tree edges are drawn without anti-aliasing, as this
    yields a crisper image.  However, when the number of leaves approaches or exceeds
    the number of pixels in the vertical portion of the display occupied by IcyTree,
    this can lead to artifacts.  Enabling this option can make such images clearer.
    
Saving and Restoring Styles
---------------------------

IcyTree can save a particular set of style options for later use.
Simply select Style-&gt;"Save current style", enter a name in the
displayed dialog box, and click Ok.  The Style-&gt;"Apply saved style"
menu should now contain an entry with the name you selected.  Choosing
this option will restore those saved style elements.

There are a couple of things to note about this feature.

1. Styles are saved using the WebStorage system implemented by modern
browsers.  Your saved styles will therefore persist between browser sessions.
However, clearing this storage from the browser settings will cause your saved
styles to be lost.

2. Not all style options are currently saved; the tree layout and node
   sorting in particular.
	
Searching taxa
==============

IcyTree provides a simple mechanism for searching for leaf nodes with
particular attribute values.

To perform a search, choose "Find nodes" from the "Search" menu.  This will
display a dialog box that allows you to enter a comma-delimited list of strings
to search for.  (Leaf nodes with an attribute value matching one or more of
these strings are interpreted as matching the search criterion.) Then, select a
specific attribute to search from the drop-down menu.  Finally, choose whether
the entire attribute value must match the search string and whether the search
will be case-sensitive.

You can also choose how to represent the search results. The default is to
highlight the edges immediately ancestral to matching nodes. You can also
choose to highlight all ancestral edges or only those that form monophyletic
clades.

Pressing the Search button will then perform the search and display the results.
Note that results are encoded in the tree by adding an annotation to matching nodes and
edges.  The name of this annotation is HIGHLIGHT by default but can be changed using
the corresponding text field in the search dialog.

The results of a search can be cleared by clicking the Clear button on the search
dialog or by selecting "Clear search results" from the Search menu.

<a name="stats"></a>

Simple statistical functions
============================

IcyTree also provides a couple of very simple and **very
experimental** statistical analysis features, including the
ability to produce lineage-through-time plots and skyline plots
from time trees.

1. The **lineages-through-time plot** (Statistics-&gt;Lineages-through-time plot) function
produces a graph showing how the number of extant lineages depends on the age above
the most recent leaf in the tree.

2. The **Skyline plot** (Statistics-&gt;Skyline plot, see [Pybus et al., 2000](http://www.genetics.org/content/155/3/1429)
and [Strimmer and Pybus, 2001](https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a003776))
provides a maximum likelihood estimate of population history from a single time tree,
assuming that the tree was produced by a coalescent process under a
piecewise constant population function. With the minimum interval length set to 0, this
is the classic skyline plot of Pybus et al. (2000), but extended to handle non-ultrametric trees.  With non-zero values for the
minimum interval length, the result is *similar* to the generalized skyline plot of Stimmer and Pybus (2001), but employs maximum likelihood rather than the method of moments to estimate the interval population sizes.

These features are highly experimental and should not yet be trusted for serious analyses.

Keyboard shortcuts
==================

Almost all options and commands in IcyTree can be accessed directly via
keyboard shortcuts. These shortcut keys (if available) are displayed to the
right of each menu item.

There are two types of keyboard shortcut:

1. Those corresponding to menu items **without** a sub-menu.

    Pressing the shortcut key is in this case equivalent to selecting the
    corresponding item from the menu. For instance, the "g" key toggles
    the edge colour legend on or off just as selecting "Display legend" from the
    file menu does.

2. Those corresponding to menu items **with** a sub-menu.

    Pressing the shortcut key in this case causes IcyTree to cycle the
    selected element in the sub-menu. For instance, the "c" key causes
    the next attribute in the Style-&gt;"Colour edges by" menu to be used
    to colour tree edges.

    Additionally, holding down SHIFT while pressing the shortcut causes IcyTree
    to select the *previous* element in the sub-menu. So pressing SHIFT+c causes
